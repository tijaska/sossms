sossms is an open source project that offers three smartphone apps that act together to help a stranded driver in a nature park to
communicate their location and problem to a rescue hub in the park, if it has one.  The rescue hub can then forward the help request
to the rescue driver best placed to render assistance.  The apps use geolocation to find out where the stranded driver is, and shows
that location to the rescue hub and drivers in a choice of maps.
