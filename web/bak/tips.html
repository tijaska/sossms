		<h2>Tips for the rescue vehicle driver</h2>
		<p>If someone driving on rough roads gets stuck in the mud or suffers a breakdown, they will usually phone the control centre
			and ask for help. It may not be easy for them to describe exactly where they are.  Most of the roads have no names.
			This may make it difficult for the driver of the rescue vehicle to find them and render assistance.</p>
		<p>The control centre staff member will invite the driver to send an S<b>o</b>S SMS with their current location attached to it.
			The SMS app on a smart phone generally has a <b>+</b> or paperclip symbol in front of its text input area.  Clicking this
			enables the user to attach their current location.  This gets sent with the SMS as a Google Maps URL, e.g.</p>
		<pre style="font-size: 125%">Unnamed Road, South Africa
<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&q=(-24.80734,28.13022)" target="_blank">https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&q=(-24.81411,28.14014)</a></pre>
		<p>The control centre staff member can't under normal circumstances drive to rescue the driver in distress, and so must relay
			the information to the driver of a rescue vehicle, ideally one that is close to the driver in distress.</p>
		<p>The simplest approach would be to forward the S<b>o</b>S SMS as another SMS to the driver of the rescue vehicle, which is easy
			to do, but unfortunately the phone number of the original sender, the driver in distress, is not included in the forwarded SMS.
			Also the link sent in an SMS defaults to "Map" view rather than Satellite view.  Small secondary roads are not shown in map view,
			so the rescue driver that receives the SMS may struggle to locate the stranded vehicle.  This app adds a satellite view link to
			the SMS before forwarding it to the rescue vehicle .</p>
