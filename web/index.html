		<h2>The S<b>o</b>S SMS System</h2>
		
		<p>Rescuing drivers in distress is a common need in nature reserves, where roads are often rough and demanding.
			<strong>SoS SMS</strong	> is a family of three smartphone apps that work together to help a driver stranded in a nature reserve
			to get assistance.  The request goes from the stranded driver to a rescue hub, which forwards it to the rescue driver best
			positioned to render assistance to the stranded driver.  The request automatically includes the stranded driver's location as
			determined by satellite based geolocation, to assist the rescue effort.</p>
		<p>The three apps are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>The caller's app</strong>, which assists the stranded driver to request help.
				The request includes the driver's details and physical location, as determined by satellite geolocation.
				The request flows to the rescue hub.</li>
			<li><strong>The rescue hub's app</strong>, which receives the stranded driver's request.
				The app displays map links that show where the stranded driver is.
				It helps the rescue hub staff to forward the request to the rescue driver best placed to handle it.</li>
			<li><strong>The rescue driver's app</strong>, which notifies the selected rescue driver
				of the request for assistance.  It includes map links that the rescue driver can use to get turn-by-turn directions to the
				stranded driver's location.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>SoS SMS is Open Source</h3>
		
		<p>All of the programs that make up the SoS SMS family are available free of charge for anyone to use and modify as they see fit,
			as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank">open source</a></p>
		
		<h3>A Sample Scenario</h3>
		
		<p>This section illustrates how the various apps in the SoS SMS family could be used to rescue a driver in distress.</p>
		<img src="images/QRcode.png" style="float:right">
		<ol>
			<li>A driver in a nature reserve encounters a muddy patch and his vehicle gets bogged down.  He needs to communicate with the
				rescue hub.
				<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
					<li>He may have been given a pamphlet on entry to the nature reserve that shows the cellphone number of the
						rescue hub. If so, he phones the rescue hub and asks for help.</li>
					<li> The pamphlet may include a QR code that contains the hub's info as a web link (see right), which he may scan.
						If so, we skip steps 2 and 3.</li>
					<li>If the caller installed app on a prior occasion, or just used the app without installing it, then the app will fill
						in the rescue hub details last seen, and steps 2 and 3 can be skipped if the caller is in the same nature reserve as
						last time.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The rescue hub operator opens the hub's SoS SMS app, types in the caller's cell number, and clicks its Send SMS button.
				This sends an SMS to the caller with the hub's information in a web link within its text. This link includes the hub's name
				and cellphone number.</li>
			<li>The caller receives the SMS and clicks on the link within it.  If the caller's app is already installed, it opens.
				Otherwise the link opens in a web page in the phone's web browser. If the caller was given a pamphlet with a QR code on it
				(see example right), scanning it would open the same app or web page.</li>
			<li>The first time the caller uses the app, he must fill in his name, cell number, vehicle type.  Thereafter the caller's app will fill
				them in as default values. Then the caller must enter the problem, and click the Send button to send an SMS back to the rescue hub.
				This SMS includes a web link that contains the caller's info, and also the caller's location as determined by the caller's app using
				satellite geolocation.</li>
			<li>The rescue hub receives the caller's SMS and clicks on the web link within it.  This automatically opens the hub's SoS SMS
				app with the caller's details and location filled in.  The hub operator can click on a map button to open the Google Maps (or
				OpenStreetMaps) app to see where the caller is.  Based on this information, the hub operator chooses the rescue driver best
				placed to assist the caller.</li>
			<li>The rescue hub operator clicks a button to forward the caller's help request to the selected driver as an SMS or WhatsApp.
				The advantage of a WhatsApp is it can be addressed to a group rather than just one individual if the hub operator isn't
				sure what the drivers are doing at that moment, and the drivers in the group can then determine amongst themselves who
				will respond to the caller's request for help.</li>
			<li>The SMS or WhatsApp forwarded to the rescue driver contains a web link which when clicked opens the rescue driver's SoS SMS
				app with the stranded caller's details filled in.  It displays map links that the rescue drive can click on to see where the
				stranded driver is.  The rescue driver can open the map and ask for turn-by-turn directions to get to the stranded driver.</li>
		</ol>
		
		
		<h3>SoS SMS App Technology Used</h3>
		
		<p>Classic phone apps require the user to find and install the app before it is needed.  And then remember what it is called
			when the need for it arises.  For frequently used apps, this is perfectly fine.  If a particular rescue hub chooses to
			use the SoS SMS app family then they will surely install the hub's app on a designated phone in the hub.  But caller's app is
			different. It is used only in emergencies. Drivers seldom set out with the intention of getting stuck, so we must assume that few
			will have found and installed the caller's app in anticipation of needing it.</p>
		
		<p>Rescue drivers will know if their rescue hub uses the hub app, and can be expected to pre-install the rescue driver's app.
			But drivers may take leave or fall ill, and other drivers may be brought in at short notice.  They may not have installed the
			rescue driver's app before needing to use it.</p>
		
		<p>For these reasons, the SoS SMS app family is implemented using the newer Progressive Web App (PWA) technology
			(see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application" target="blank">here</a>).
			Once installed, a PWA behaves exactly like a classic phone app.  It can be launched by clicking on its icon on the home screen.
			But casual users can use PWAs immediately, without first having to find them in a web store and install them.  All they need is
			a link to the app in question, and a web browser on their phone. Which is standard.  More frequent users like the rescue hub
			and rescue drivers can easily install their respective apps in advance of needing to use them, put a launch icon on their home
			screen, and open it instantly when needed.</p>
		
		<p>And when messages flow from one member of the SoS SMS family to another, they include links which, if clicked, will automatically
			open the appropriate app on the receiver's phone, if installed, or otherwise open the app in the receiving phone's web browser.
			It is seldom that a user will have to find and open the app that they need. The system is designed to be simple and robust.</p>
		
		<h3>Install the SoS SMS Apps</h3>
		<img src="images/install.png" style="float:right">
		
		<p>After being used a few times, each app should offer to install itself on the user's phone. This process can be speeded up, as described
			below for various phone types.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For Chrome on Android, open the app as a normal web page in the phone's browser, click on the browser's menu (three vertical
				dots in the top right corner) and then click on the <b>Install app</b> option (boxed in red in the image to the right).</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Web Server Requirements</h3>
		
		<p>A trial implementation of the SoS SMS family of apps is available for evaluation at
			<a href="https://tijaska.co.za/sos/" target="_blank">https://tijaska.co.za/sos/</a>.
			This is a development server, and it is often taken down to implement and test new software components. This makes it completely
			unsuitable to support a live production system that may play an important role in the rescue of stranded drivers.</p>
		
		<p>Anyone who wants to use the SoS SMS software is free to do so, but they need to find a web server operator who is willing to host it
			for them.  The packaged web app can be downloaded <b>from ??</b>. 
		
		<p>Smartphone apps and web apps are usually designed to interact with programs that run on web servers. A large number of different
			programming languages are used to code the web server programs. No one web server supports all of these languages. In order to
			support as wide a range of web servers as possible, so that users have freedom in choosing web service providers or providing their
			own, the SoS SMS app family has been designed and developed to run without the need for any server-side application programs of its own.
			The required application logic is built into the web pages that make up the family.  They communicate with one another using SMS
			or WhatsApp technologies, which are universally available. SMSes are cheap, and WhatsApps are free.</p>

		<h3>Try it out</h3>
		
		<p>You can access, test, and optionally install the three apps that make up the SoS SMS family here:</p>
		<ul class="space" style="list-style-type: disc;">
			<li><a href='caller/' target='_blank'>The stranded driver's app</a></li>
			<li><a href='hub/' target='_blank'>The rescue hub app</a></li>
			<li><a href='rescue/' target='_blank'>The rescue driver's app</a></li>
		</ul>
		<ol>
		<li>Open the rescue hub app first, and click the <strong>Check or change the hub configuration</strong> box to configure a test rescue hub.
			Put in your own name and phone number. Then use it to send a test SMS to the "stranded driver". This could be yourself, or an accomplice.</li>
		<li>The chosen "stranded driver" who receives the test SMS must click on the web link within it. This will open the stranded driver's app
			in a browser page. They can fill in their details and click the <strong>Send</strong> button to send these details back to the rescue
			hub as an SMS message.</li>
		<li>The rescue hub should receive the SMS and click on the web link within it. This will open the rescue hub app and display the stranded
			driver's details.</li>
		<li>The rescue hub operator must then click the <strong>WhatsApp</strong> or <strong>SMS</strong> button to forward the rescue request to a
			rescue driver. They will be prompted to choose the recipient of this message.</li>
		<li>The chosen rescue driver will receive the SMS. They must click on the web link within it to open the rescue driver's SoS SMS app.
			This will display the stranded driver's request for help, details, and links to maps that can show the stranded driver's location
			and provide turn-by-turn guidance to finding them.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>The Map Types Offered</h3>
		<p>The SoS SMS apps offer three different map types to show where the stranded driver is located.</p>
		<h4>Google Maps Street View</h4>
		<p>This is the familiar default type of map offered by Google Maps.  It works very well for towns and cities where it's easy to tell
			what is a road and what is not. It works less well in nature reserves where many of the roads may be dirt tracks. Some roads won't
			show as roads at all, or only in patches. Google Maps should be able to give good navigation advice while the rescue driver is
			traveling on bigger roads, but if it doesn't recognize the smaller roads then it will be unable to give turn-by-turn directions in
			those areas.</p>
		<p>By way of example, the street map displayed here comes from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@-24.8022234,28.1287166,17z">here</a>
			<br>It shows some of the small roads in a game reserve, but not many compared to the satellite view below.</p>
		<img src="images/streetmap.jpg">
		<h4>Google Maps Satellite View</h4>
		<p>It turns out that the human eye is pretty good as picking out dirt tracks.  The Google navigation advice won't be any different from
			what it is in street view, but the rescue driver should be able to see and follow a route once the larger roads peter out.</p>
		<p>The same area shown above is shown here in satellite view
			<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@-24.8022234,28.1287166,718m/data=!3m1!1e3">here</a>
			<br>Far more roads can be seen.  Even rainwater runoff channels are visible.</p>
		<img src="images/satellite.jpg">
		<h4>OpenStreetMap</h4>
		<p>OpenStreetMap is very similar to Google Maps street view in appearance, but seems to do a better job of picking out smaller secondary
			roads.  It can either run in a browser window, or the user can download and install the app as one does Google Maps. The advantage of
			having the app installed is that it offers turn-by-turn navigation, in the same way as Google Maps does.</p>
		<p>OpenStreetMaps makes it easy for the user to edit the map, adding road and place names, even adding smaller roads that the
			OpenStreetMap scanning process may have missed.
			It is easy to run a companion app called OSMTracker while traversing roads in an area of interest.
			This app uses geolocation to record the physical route followed, and hence the actual course of the road.
