		<h3>Help for the Hub SoS SMS App</h3>
		<p>A rescue hub offers assistance to drivers stranded in the area that they serve. The driver's vehicle may be
			stuck in mud, have a flat battery, have run out of fuel, or whatever. The stranded driver must phone the rescue
			hub and ask for assistance.  Locating where the driver got stranded can be a problem.  The SoS SMS apps help to
 			solve this problem by using the geolocation facilities of the caller's cellphone to pinpoint where they are.
			The app send this together with other information entered by the caller to the rescue hub.</p>
		<h4>Configure the rescue hub</h4>
		<p>The rescue hub needs to designate a cellphone that will receive calls for rescue, and publish its number.
			The first time the hub opens the hub SoS SMS app on that phone they will be invited to configure the hub.  This
			means entering its name and phone number.  The hub app will use geolocation to get the location of the hub. You
			can review and edit this info any time the hub app is open by clicking on the checkbox in front of the line
			<strong>Check or change your hub configuration</strong>. The information that you enter will be recorded by the app.</p>
		<p>If the hub phone is initially configured indoors, geolocation may struggle to get good satellite signals. Please click
			the <strong>Show location on map</strong> button and check that your location is right. If not, please take the phone
			outdoors where it has a clear view of the skies and click the <strong>click here</strong> button to get a fresh location.</p>
		<h4>Sending an SoS SMS Invite to a Caller</h4>
		<p>When a driver in trouble calls the hub, the operator who takes the call must enter the caller's cell number into
			the app as requested, and click the <strong>send SMS</strong> button. The app will open the normal SMS app with
			an invitation already present. All the hub operator needs to do is click the <strong>Send</strong> button.</p>
		<h4>Responding to an SoS SMS request from a Caller</h4>
		<p>When a caller gets an SmS SOS invite from the rescue hub and clicks on the link in the SMS it will open the caller's app.
			This app will get the caller's location and ask them to enter their name, vehicle type, and a short description of the
			problem that they have. They then click their <strong>send SMS</strong> button and a request will flow to the rescue hub's
			phone as an SMS. When the hub operator clicks on the link in this SMS, it will open the hub's SoS SMS app with the caller's
			details and location displayed.</p>
		<h4>Forwarding the Rescue Request to a Rescue Driver</h4>
		<p>The hub operator can then click on the <strong>Choose map type</strong> button to see where the stranded caller is located.
			Different map types are offered since some work better than others in various circumstances. The hub operator can then 
			confer with the rescue vehicle drivers on duty to find out which one is best able to render assistance. The hub operator
			may enter the chosen rescue driver's cell number, or leave it empty, then click the <strong>SMS</strong> or
			<strong>WhatsApp</strong> button. This will open the normal SMS or WhatsApp app with the rescue message already inserted.
			All the hub operator need do is click the <strong>Send</strong> button.  If the rescue driver's number was not previously
			entered then the SMS or WhatsApp app will ask the hub operator to choose a recipient from contacts.</p>
		<p>If the hub and rescue drivers agree on using WhatsApp to exchange rescue messages then the hub operator could send a
			message to a group rather than just one individual rescue driver. Each organisation must decide what suits them best.</p>
